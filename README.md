A Bootstrap redesign of Hacker News with a while preserving the minimal and simple essence.


## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This project reimagines the notoriously minimalist Hacker News website with a responsive, card-based layout using Bootstrap 5. The goal was to create a more visually appealing interface while maintaining the simple functionality that makes Hacker News great.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Responsive card-based layout** for better readability
- **Three content sections**: Top Stories, News, and Jobs

## ðŸŒŸ Why This Project?

The original Hacker News is renowned for its ultra-minimalist design that prioritizes content over aesthetics. This redesign was created as a learning exercise to:

1. Practice implementing Bootstrap's grid system and components
2. Gain experience working with third-party REST APIs
3. Improve UI/UX design skills by modernizing a familiar interface
4. Learn proper AJAX handling and asynchronous JavaScript
5. And also becuase I was bored
